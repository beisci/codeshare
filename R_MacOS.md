# Install R and compile packages from source on MacOS

Latest versions of MacOS have a lot of problems when it comes to installing R and making it compile packages from source smoothly. Here are the steps that led to successful installation of R on a new Mac lately, with no issues compiling from source. Please google for the latest download links the texts refer to.

## 1. Installing X Code from App Store
After installation, open it to accept terms; then need to install command line tools: go to terminal, type in `xcode-select --install`.

## 2. Install xQuaz/X11
Google the latest link for installation.

## 3. Install Java JDK
After insalling, go to Terminal, sign in as root user, type in `R CMD javareconf` so it's set up. This requires root user to be enabled so java can access and write. To enable root user, type in Terminal the following: `dsenableroot to enable root user`. Sometimes the latest Java JDK doesnâ€™t work (e.g., current Java JDK 12 is not supported, while version 11 is), so install the appropriate version of Java JDK again, then go to `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines` and remove the directory whose name matches the following format `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdkmajor.minor.macro[_update].jdk`. Do not attempt to uninstall Java by removing the Java tools from `/usr/bin`. Once only the appropriate Java version is present in above folder, re-run `R CMD javareconf`.

## 4. Install clang
Go to R homepage, and there is a list of R tools for Mac, pick correct version of clang for the current R version. During installation, there are instructions on creating paths, need to follow these instructions for clang to work.

## 5. Install gfortran
The version on R page rtools does not currently work, use [github fortran for Mojave](https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS/releases)
